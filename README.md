# K-Means Clustering
This code initializes some data points, randomly chooses initial centroids, assigns each data point to the nearest centroid, updates the centroids based on the mean of the points in each cluster, and repeats these steps until the centroids no longer change. Finally, it outputs the clusters and centroids.
